Here I collect some play programs to learn a bit about Amiga SW development

As SDK I use this great and well maintained Amiga GCC package: https://github.com/bebbo/amiga-gcc
In addition some amiga-ecosystem related tools are used, from the suite amitools: https://amitools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

One needs the (proprietary) libraries to run the software - you may need to extract that from your Kickstart ROMs or workbench floppies.
